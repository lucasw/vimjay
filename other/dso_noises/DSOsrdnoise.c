 * DSOsrdnoise.c
 *
 * Simplex noise for SL with rotating gradients and an analytic
 * derivative, over 2 and 3 dimensions, in a DSO shadeop.
 *
 * The SL functions defined by this DSO are:
 * srdnoise( float x, y, t )
 * srdnoise( float x, y, t; output float dx, dy )
 * srdnoise( point P; float t )
 * srdnoise( point P; float t; output float dx, dy, dz )
 *
 * The actual "srdnoise2" and "srdnoise3" functions in C are
 * implemented in a separate file, "srdnoise23.c", which needs
 * to be compiled and linked with this file.
 *
 * The parameters to the SL functions are:
 * (x,y) or P    Texture coordinates for the point being shaded
 * t             Rotation angle for the swirling motion (should be animated!)
 * dx, dy [, dz] Output: the true analytic derivative of the noise function
 *
 * Note that the return value is in the interval [-1, 1], not in [0, 1],
 * simply because it is most convenient and useful to have it that way.
